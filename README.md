idock
=====

idock is a multithreaded [virtual screening] tool for flexible ligand [docking] for computational drug discovery. It is inspired by [AutoDock Vina], and is hosted by GitHub at https://GitHub.com/HongjianLi/idock under [Apache License 2.0]. idock is now available as a service at [istar].


Features
--------

* idock develops its own io service pool to reuse threads and maintain a high CPU utilization throughout the entire docking procedure. The io service pool parallelizes the precalculation of scoring function, the creation of grid maps, and the execution of Monte Carlo tasks.
* idock supports as many as 27 chemical elements, i.e. H, C, N, O, S, Se, P, F, Cl, Br, I, Zn, Fe, Mg, Ca, Mn, Cu, Na, K, Hg, Ni, Co, Cd, As, Sr, U and Cs.
* idock outputs per-atom free energy for protein-ligand interaction hotspot detection.
* idock outputs summary for each predicted conformation into a CSV file for subsequent analysis.
* idock provides precompiled 64bit executables for Linux and Windows.


Supported operating systems and compilers
-----------------------------------------

* Arch Linux x86_64 and CLANG 3.4
* Windows 7 SP1 x64 and Visual Studio 2013


Compilation
-----------

idock depends on [Boost C++ Libraries]. Boost 1.55.0 is tested. The Boost libraries required by idock are `System`, `Filesystem` and `Program Options`.

### Compilation on Linux

The Makefile uses CLANG as the default compiler. To compile, simply run

    make

One may modify the Makefile to use a different compiler or different compilation options.

The generated objects will be placed in the `obj` folder, and the generated executable will be placed in the `bin` folder.

### Compilation on Windows

Visual Studio 2013 solution and project files are provided. To compile, simply run

    msbuild /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release

Or one may open `idock.sln` in Visual Studio 2013 and do a full rebuild.

The generated objects will be placed in the `obj` folder, and the generated executable will be placed in the `bin` folder.


Usage
-----

First add idock to the PATH environment variable.

To display a full list of available options, simply run the program without arguments

    idock

The `examples` folder contains several use cases. For example, to dock the ligand TMC278 against HIV-1 RT of PDB ID 2ZD1,

    cd examples/2ZD1/T27

One can supply the options from command line arguments

    idock --receptor ../../../receptors/2ZD1.pdbqt --input_folder ../../../ligands/T27 --output_folder output --center_x 49.712 --center_y -28.923 --center_z 36.824 --size_x 18 --size_y 18 --size_z 20

Or one can instruct idock to load the options from a configuration file

    idock --config idock.conf


Documentation
-------------

Documentations in both HTML and LaTeX formats can be esaily created by running [doxygen]

    doxygen idock.dox

The created documents will be placed in `doc` folder. To compile LaTeX files into PDF, one must have `pdflatex` installed.

    cd doc/latex
    make

The generated PDF will be `refman.pdf`.
